## Html 

### **Links** 
-	**Links** are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing
-	Links are **created** using the ***a***  element. Users can click on anything between the opening tag and the closing tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
-	You can set a name of the link between the closing and the opening tags.

*	On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
*	Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
*	mailto: is an e mail link. example : href="mailto:jon@example.org
*	If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening tag. Example : href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank"
*	Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page. By butting an id to the part then a href=”#top” 
*	Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page: href="http:/www. htmlandcssbookcom/ #bottom"

## CSS

### **Layout**

*	Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: **h1/p/ul/li**
*	Inline elements flow in between surrounding text : **img/b/i**
*	In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. position: static; I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.
*	Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
*	Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.

### **screen size**

*	Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
*	Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
*	Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
*	Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages


## JS

### **Funcion methods and objects**

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.

**what is a function**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

*	To create a function u must give if a name function functionName curly brackets 
*	To call a function just type the name of the function then parentheses functionName ();
*	Parameters are what we give the function info or value 
*	 We put the value or the info that the pram. Needs inside the calling parentheses 

## **Variables**

*	The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
*	Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

## **Why pair programming**

1.	Great efficiency 
2.	Engaged collaboration 
3.	Learning from other students 
4.	Social skills 
5.	Job interview readings
