## CSS

### **Layout**
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
1. normal flow
2. relative positioning
3. absolute

* **box offset** properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.
1. fixed position 
2. floating position

### **screen size**

*	Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

*	Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

*	Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

*	Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages
