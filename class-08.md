## CSS

### **Layout**

*	Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: **h1/p/ul/li**
*	Inline elements flow in between surrounding text : **img/b/i**
*	In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. position: static; I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.
*	Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
*	Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
