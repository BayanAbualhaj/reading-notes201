## JavaScripts 

* When you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to **these events**.

* ***event handeling*** :
1. Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to.

2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.
3.  State the code you want to run when the event occurs. 

## HTML

### Forms
* Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
form element.

* Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.

* There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site:

**How the forms works** :
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects.
3. The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.
4. The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.



### Lists , Tables and Forms :

* In addition to the CSS properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

* List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
