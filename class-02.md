## JavaScripts 

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
* STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE
* STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS
* MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS /* *text* */ 
* SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS //text
* A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables
* A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.
* Var name = vlue;


* Variable types 
1.	The numeric data type var = 5;
2.	The strings data type var bayan= ‘bayan’;
3.	Boolean data types var correct= true;


* Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the same script.


* Rules for naming variables
-	The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number
-	The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name
-	You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
-	All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases
-	Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
-	If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.


* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

1. there are 3 types of **logical** operator 
- not **!**
- or **double |** 
- and **&&**
2. types of copmression operators 
- **==** equal
- **!=** not equal 
- **===** strict equal 
- **!==** not strict equal
- **<** less than
- **>** larger than 
- **>=** larger or equal
- **<=** less or equal 

* we use this operators in **loops** if the condition is **true** then the loop can run 
* the loop keep running till the codition is **false**

* there is 3 types of loops 
1. **FOR**
2. **WHILE** 
3. **DO WHILE** 

- if we want to loop for specific nubmer we use *for* 
- if we want to loop for non-specific number we use *while*
-and we use *do while* as we use *while* but *do while* will run the code one time before checking the condition is true or false.
