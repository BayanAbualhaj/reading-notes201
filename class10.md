## JavaScript
* JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes
mistakes when writing it. 

* It will also teach you how to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully.


* If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception.At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handl ing code. 

* **Error objects** can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them. 

* Please note that these error messages are from the Chrome browser. Other browsers' error messages may vary: 
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number
and gives a description of the error.

### How to deal with errors :
1. DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS:Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a
process of deduction. 


2. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY:You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch,throw, and f i na 1 ly statements.
If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.

3. logging data in the console :The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

* ***event handeling*** :
1. Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to.

2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.
3.  State the code you want to run when the event occurs.
